# JetStar
2D video game I developed while I was at University back in 2011. This was written in C++, I used our in-house graphics library called Gwin. Just a word of warning, the code is not pretty at all ! :-)

To play the game download the 'JetStar' folder to PC and execute the 'JetStar.exe' file. This was built and packaged for Windows OS only.
